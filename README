    Ashigaru - a demo GPU tiled slicer 
=========================================

What is Ashigaru? first, says Wikipedia: 

  Ashigaru (足軽 "light [of] foot") were foot-soldiers employed by the samurai class of feudal Japan. 

In other words, cannon-fodder, or rather Katana-fodder.

What is Ashigaru? It's cannon-fodder. It's a test of a new architecture for a component of Katana,
and a sandbox on which to try new things. 

Ashigaru contains the following:

* RenderServer, a class to manage a thread that does OpenGL rendering.
* TiledView - a class that helps the server do the rendering in tiles.
* RenderAction (and child) - example of how to do async rendering with multiple outputs.

The test program is in main.cpp, it just runs a render on one model (crystal.stl), 
duplicating it to show the features of coloring by ID. The outputs are a color image by ID, 
and an unsigned short proximity map.

How to run
-----------
Most of the development was done on Linux. The steps for Linux are:

1. Install the dependency packages: GLEW, OpenGL, GLFW, libpng.

2. In the Ashigaru root directory, run:

  $ md build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ../
  $ make
  $ cd ..
  $ build/ashigaru --slice 500   # or some other slice

3. There will be two new files in the working direcrory: dump.png and 
   depth.png. Enjoy.

On windows: there is a VS project supplied. Build with it, and run. 
Dependencies will be handled by NuGet. Make sure that the working 
directory is the ashigaru root, because the paths to shaders are specified 
relative to it.

How to complain

Either you know where to find me, or this project is not really up for collaboration. Sorry.
